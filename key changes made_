1. Added new sanitary tab in the template with proper upload  2. Updated handleFileUpload to properly categorize and save sanitization documents
3. Added support for loading saved sanitization files on page load
4. Includeds initiaization code in DOMContentLoaded event

The changes a should now:
- Show separate tab forn sanitization documents
- Allow uploading multiple file uploads
- Maintain persistent file lists between page refreshes
- Support deleting individual files
- Show appropriate empty state when no files are uploaded

This matches the existing pattern used for the Oe and guide files while providing dedicated ect section for sanitation-related documents.
